# San Francisco Food Truck Map

This app uses API data to show where Food Trucks in San Francisco are currently located. It provides information about the trucks and the current address. 

The sidebar is a drawer style menu that you can hide by clicking the side button. There are also 3 buttons on top to display food trucks within a specified radius. 

The buttons would localize to the user's specific location. 

NOTE: This app will only display food trucks in San Francisco. The buttons will still localize but will not display any trucks outside San Francisco.
